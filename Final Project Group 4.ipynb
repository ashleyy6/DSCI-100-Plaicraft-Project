    "## **1) Introduction**\n",
    "Understanding what drives players to subscribe to game-related newsletters is essential for gaming studios and their marketing teams as they aim to build lasting connections with their audiences. Newsletter subscriptions provide a direct communication channel, enabling companies to share game updates, release announcements, and promotional content without relying on external platforms. By identifying the player characteristics associated with a higher likelihood of subscribing, studios can refine their outreach strategies, personalize their messaging, and ultimately foster stronger, long-term engagement within their player communities."

    "## i) The Central Question Explored in this Project - Broken into Two Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Broad Question:**\n",
    "What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game‑related newsletter, and how do these features differ between different player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "*(For this report, we narrow the focus to two easily measurable attributes available in the dataset, which are **age** and **hours played**).*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Specific Question:**\n",
    "Can age and total hours played predict whether a player is subscribed to the newsletter in the players dataset?"

    "## ii) Dataset Description\n",
    "The analysis uses the **players dataset**, which contains anonymized information about in‑game behaviours and demographics. The variables relevant to this report include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **age:** The player's age in years (numeric).\n",
    "2) **hours_played:** Total hours spent playing the game (numeric).\n",
    "3) **subscribed:** Whether the player is subscribed to the game newsletter (binary).\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables allow us to evaluate whether basic demographic and engagement features can predict a player’s likelihood of subscribing. The dataset is also appropriate for this question because it links individual characteristics to the outcome of interest, making it suitable for both exploratory and predictive analysis. Lastly, this dataset allows us to examine whether simple behavioural and demographic variables can provide meaningful predictive power when determining newsletter subscription tendencies."
